#Tools
I didn't use any libraries or tools other than vanilla javascript. It's a timer, it's tiny, there's no nead for jQuery or any other external library.

#Time
It took me about 40 minutes to write +- some pretty significant bugs and the delivery of a new couch

#Bugs
We'll find out in 2017


#BTW
I webpacked, and I gitignored bundle.js and bundle.js.map to write in es2015. To run, npm install and webpack
